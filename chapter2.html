				<h1>Chapter 2</h1>
                <p><br />The grand hall was adorned with a certain energy, a palpable excitement that seemed to ripple through the air as renowned pianist Yoo Joonghyuk and his group gathered for an intense practice session. The upcoming piano concerto was a monumental event, a chance to showcase their prowess in the world of classical music. At the helm was their trusted conductor, Nirvana, a dear friend who knew each member's strengths and quirks intimately.</p>
                <p>Yoo Joonghyuk, an embodiment of passion and dedication, sat poised before the grand piano, his fingers gently caressing the ivory keys. With a stern expression, he glanced around at his fellow musicians, a mixture of camaraderie and determination reflected in their eyes. Han Sooyoung, elegant and confident, wielded her cello with grace, while Yoo Sangah's focused gaze showed her unwavering commitment to perfection.</p>
                <p>Nirvana, the enigmatic conductor, raised his baton, and the atmosphere shifted. The room fell into a deep silence, pregnant with anticipation. As the first notes of the concerto resonated, the musicians found themselves immersed in a shared journey of musical storytelling. Joonghyuk's fingers danced across the piano keys, his emotions flowing through each note, creating a harmonious dialogue with the cellos' rich tones.</p>
                <p>The practice was a symphony of collaboration, the musicians communicating through their instruments, guided by Nirvana's skilled direction. He was a conductor who understood the nuances of each musician's style, drawing out their finest performances and weaving them together into a tapestry of sound. His gestures were precise, evoking crescendos that surged like waves and diminuendos that faded into whispers.</p>
                <p>Between movements, Joonghyuk's fingers left the keys, and he wiped his brow with a handkerchief. His eyes met Han Sooyoung's and Yoo Sangah's, and a shared smile passed between them&mdash;a testament to the deep bond they held beyond their roles as musicians. Despite the pressure of the upcoming performance, their friendship remained an anchor, a source of strength that fueled their musical synergy.</p>
                <p>During a particularly challenging passage, Nirvana's guidance took on a more intense form. He urged them to dig deeper, to find the hidden emotions within the music and let them flourish. The room was charged with an electrifying tension as they repeated the passage, each iteration revealing new layers of depth and complexity.</p>
                <p>As the final movement of the concerto drew near, the intensity in the hall surged. Yoo Joonghyuk's fingers danced with even greater fervour, his connection to the instrument palpable. The harmonious interplay between the piano and the cellos was mesmerising, a true testament to the hours of practice and dedication they had poured into their craft.</p>
                <p>In a fleeting moment, Yoo Joonghyuk's gaze drifted beyond the keys and the orchestra. His eyes locked onto a figure in the audience, a figure that stirred something within him. There, seated amidst the crowd, was Kim Dokja.&nbsp;</p>
                <p><em>Why is he here!?</em></p>
                <p>Kim Dokja sat in the front row, his intense gaze fixed on the stage. Yoo Joonghyuk's heart quickened as he caught Kim Dokja's eye, a slight blush rising to his cheeks. It was a rare moment of vulnerability for him, a vulnerability that only music and Dokja seemed to elicit, a subtle exchange of recognition passing between them. It was a moment that seemed to stretch beyond time, a connection that resonated deeper than the music they were creating.</p>
                <p>As the concerto approached its final passages, Yoo Joonghyuk found himself drawn back into the music, his focus renewed. The final notes hung in the air, a triumphant conclusion that left the audience breathless. The applause that followed was thunderous, echoing through the hall as a testament to the musicians' mastery.</p>
                <p>After taking a bow alongside his fellow performers, Yoo Joonghyuk couldn't shake the image of Kim Dokja from his mind. He knew he had to seize the opportunity to talk to him, to bridge the gap that had kept them apart.</p>
                <p>As the crowd began to disperse, Yoo Joonghyuk made his way towards the front of the stage, his heart pounding in his chest.&nbsp;<br />He saw Kim Dokja standing at a distance, his dark hair falling gracefully over his forehead. Their eyes met for a fleeting moment, and Yoo Joonghyuk's heart raced. But before he could gather his thoughts and approach, he saw Kim Dokja taking steps toward him. A mixture of surprise and nervousness washed over him as Kim Dokja's gaze held his.</p>
                <p>However, as Kim Dokja neared, Yoo Joonghyuk noticed something unusual. Kim Dokja's lips moved, as if he were trying to speak, but no words emerged. It was as if his voice had abandoned him in this crucial moment. Yoo Joonghyuk's heart ached at the sight of Kim Dokja's struggle.</p>
                <p>Just then, Yoo Joonghyuk's attention shifted as he noticed someone else accompanying Kim Dokja. It was a young woman with a warm smile, standing beside the violinist. Yoo Joonghyuk recognized her as Kim Dokja's older sister, Eun-Ji. His curiosity was piqued by her presence, wondering what role she might play in this encounter.</p>
                <p>As if sensing his thoughts, Eun-Ji stepped forward, breaking the tension that had enveloped them. "You must be Yoo Joonghyuk," she said with a friendly tone, extending her hand. Yoo Joonghyuk nodded and shook her hand, his nerves still running high.</p>
                <p>"Eun-Ji," she introduced herself, her eyes glinting with mischief. "I couldn't help but notice that my brother seemed a bit tongue-tied just now."</p>
                <p>Yoo Joonghyuk managed a small smile, relieved that someone had acknowledged the awkwardness of the situation. "Yes, it appears so."</p>
                <p>Eun-Ji chuckled softly. "You know, he's usually not this shy. But I think you might have left him a bit starstruck."</p>
                <p>Yoo Joonghyuk's cheeks tinged with a faint blush, but he didn't respond. Instead, he turned his gaze back to Kim Dokja, who was now looking at them from a distance, a hint of frustration in his eyes.</p>
                <p>Eun-Ji's expression turned thoughtful as she observed her brother's behaviour. "He's been practising his violin day and night, trying to find the perfect melody. He's quite dedicated to his craft."</p>
                <p>Yoo Joonghyuk nodded in understanding. He had always admired Kim Dokja's commitment to music, a dedication that resonated with his own passion for the piano. It was one of the reasons he had been drawn to Kim Dokja in the first place.</p>
                <p>Eun-Ji smiled at Yoo Joonghyuk's nod. "You played beautifully just now. Kim Dokja rarely applauds, but your performance managed to earn his appreciation."</p>
                <p>A mixture of pride and relief filled Yoo Joonghyuk's chest. Knowing that Kim Dokja had acknowledged his music was an accomplishment in itself. He stole another glance at Kim Dokja, who was now engaged in a quiet conversation with another member of the ensemble.</p>
                <p>Eun-Ji's voice brought him back to the present. "We're actually here because of Nirvana," she said with a wink. "Your friend, right?"</p>
                <p>Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes widened slightly. "Yes, he is."</p>
                <p>"Nirvana invited us to watch your performance," Eun-Ji explained. "And well, you can see how things turned out."</p>
                <p>Yoo Joonghyuk couldn't help but feel a mixture of annoyance and gratitude towards his mischievous friend. "He has quite the sense of timing."</p>
                <p>Eun-Ji laughed. "Indeed, he does. But don't be too hard on him. He just thought it would be a good opportunity for Kim Dokja to finally talk to you."</p>
                <p>Yoo Joonghyuk's heart skipped a beat at the mention of Kim Dokja's intention. He was about to say something when Eun-Ji suddenly turned serious. "You know, there's something off about Dokja today. He's not usually this shy, even around people he's just met."</p>
                <p>Yoo Joonghyuk's brows furrowed in concern. He had sensed something different in Kim Dokja's demeanour, but he hadn't been able to pinpoint it. He decided to push those thoughts aside for now, focusing on the conversation at hand.</p>
                <p>As they continued talking, the performance hall's doors swung open, and a familiar figure entered with a grin on his face. "Yoo Joonghyuk, you sly fox! You actually came to talk to Kim Dokja!" Nirvana exclaimed, his eyes dancing with amusement.</p>
                <p>Yoo Joonghyuk's annoyance returned, and he shot his friend with a pointed look. "You had quite the plan, didn't you?"</p>
                <p>Nirvana chuckled. "Well, it seems like my plan worked, even if it wasn't executed the way I expected." He gestured towards Kim Dokja, who was now looking at them with a mixture of embarrassment and relief.</p>
                <p>Yoo Joonghyuk's lips twitched into a half-smile. Perhaps Nirvana's interference hadn't been all bad. It had led to this moment, a moment when Yoo Joonghyuk had finally mustered the courage to approach Kim Dokja.</p>
