				<h1>Chapter 3</h1>
                <p>The piano concerto practice had been nothing short of breathtaking. Yoo Joonghyuk had poured his heart and soul into his performance, and the music had resonated through the grand hall like a gentle breeze, capturing the hearts of everyone in the audience. But for Yoo Joonghyuk, there was something even more remarkable about that evening—the chance to finally meet his favorite violinist, Kim Dokja. He'd been enraptured by his artistry from the moment they met, and he couldn't wait to get to know him better.</p>

                <p>Nirvana had played a pivotal role in orchestrating this encounter. Yoo Joonghyuk had been avoiding any direct interaction with his idol, unsure of how to handle the situation. It was Nirvana who had invited Kim Dokja and his older sister to attend the practice, bridging the gap that Yoo Joonghyuk had been hesitant to cross.</p>
                
                <p>~~~</p>
                
                <p>Nirvana, Yoo Joonghyuk began hesitantly, "did you feel something... off about Kim Dokja during our conversation earlier?"  He had a feeling he was hiding something, but he wasn't sure what it was.</p>
                
                <p>Nirvana laughed heartily at the question, as if he had been expecting it. "Apart from the fact that you were acting like you had seen a ghost?" he asked.</p>
                
                <p>Yoo Joonghyuk frowned. "I was just... surprised. Meeting someone I admire so much, it's natural to be a bit nervous."</p>
                
                <p>Nirvana's teasing smile didn't fade. "Sure, Joonghyuk. Nervousness, that's what we'll call it. But no, I didn't sense anything unusual. He seemed like a nice guy."</p>
                
                <p>Yoo Joonghyuk sighed in relief, thinking that maybe he was overanalyzing the situation. "I see. It's just that I... I wanted to make a good impression."</p>
                
                <p>Nirvana raised an eyebrow, his playful demeanor shifting to a more serious one. "Joonghyuk, if this is about romantic interest, you know you can tell me. I won't judge."</p>
                
                <p>Yoo Joonghyuk scowled, but he didn't rise to the bait. "I'm serious, Nirvana. There was something off about him."</p>
                
                <p>Nirvana's expression grew more thoughtful. "Now that you mention it, yeah, I did feel something was a bit... off. Like he wasn't really there, you know?"</p>
                
                <p>Yoo Joonghyuk nodded in agreement. "Exactly. It's like he was going through the motions, but his mind was elsewhere."</p>
                
                <p>Nirvana shrugged. "Maybe he was just nervous or distracted. Meeting his fans can be overwhelming."</p>
                
                <p>Yoo Joonghyuk shook his head, a frown creasing his forehead. "No, it wasn't that. I've met other musicians I admire, and they didn't give off the same vibe. It's like there's something he's not telling us."</p>
                
                <p>Nirvana raised an eyebrow, intrigued by Yoo Joonghyuk's seriousness. "You think he's hiding something?"</p>
                
                <p>Yoo Joonghyuk sighed, his gaze fixed on the ground. "I don't know, Nirvana. But whatever it is, it's bothering me. I can't just ignore it."</p>
                
                <p>Nirvana placed a reassuring hand on Yoo Joonghyuk's shoulder. "Well, you're not alone in this, Joonghyuk. If you ever decide to dig deeper into this mystery, count me in."</p>
                
                <p>Yoo Joonghyuk offered a small, grateful smile. "Thanks, Nirvana. I appreciate it."</p>
                
                <p>.<br />
                .<br />
                .</p>
                
                <p>Yoo Joonghyuk paced back and forth in his room, the weight of his emotions pressing down on him like an unbearable burden. His phone lay on his desk, Kim Dokja's number displayed prominently on the screen alongside the word "call." It was a simple action—just a press of a button away—but for Yoo Joonghyuk, it felt like crossing a chasm on a rickety bridge. He was fighting an internal battle with his shyness and nervousness, and it seemed like his usual cold demeanor had abandoned him at this crucial moment.</p>
                
                <p>He couldn't deny that he wanted to hear Kim Dokja's voice, to reconnect with the person who had become so important to him. But the thought of making that call filled him with a nervousness he hadn't experienced in years. His heart raced, and he could feel the warmth of a blush creeping up his cheeks.</p>
                
                <p>What would he say? What could they possibly talk about? The question echoed in his mind like a never-ending loop, causing his anxiety to intensify. Yoo Joonghyuk's mind was a battlefield, and he was losing the fight against his own shyness.</p>
                
                <p>Just as he reached for his phone, ready to press that elusive "call" button, the door to his room swung open with a creak. Yoo Joonghyuk froze, and his eyes darted to the intruder. It was Nirvana, a friend who had come to visit him for the day. Nirvana's eyes immediately landed on Yoo Joonghyuk's phone screen, and a sly smirk tugged at his lips.</p>
                
                <p>"Well, well, well," Nirvana taunted, stepping further into the room. "What do we have here, Joonghyuk? Planning to call someone special?"</p>
                
                <p>Yoo Joonghyuk's embarrassment reached new heights as his cheeks turned an even deeper shade of red. He quickly snatched the phone off the desk and tried to hide it behind his back, but it was too late.</p>
                
                <p>Nirvana chuckled and walked closer, not giving Yoo Joonghyuk a moment's respite. "Oh, come on, Joonghyuk. You're usually so cold around people, and now you're acting like a shy schoolgirl with a crush."</p>
                
                <p>Yoo Joonghyuk scowled, feeling the weight of his friend's teasing. He wasn't used to this kind of banter, and it made him all the more uncomfortable. "Mind your own business, Nirvana."</p>
                
                <p>But Nirvana was relentless, following Yoo Joonghyuk out of the room, still grinning from ear to ear. "I can't believe it. The mighty Yoo Joonghyuk, afraid to make a simple phone call. What's the worst that could happen?"</p>
                
                <p>Yoo Joonghyuk clenched his jaw and kept walking, determined to escape Nirvana's relentless teasing. He couldn't explain the turmoil inside him, the mixture of longing and self-doubt that had him trapped. It wasn't just a phone call; it was a step toward vulnerability, something he had always struggled with.</p>
                
                <p>Nirvana's laughter echoed behind him as he finally left Yoo Joonghyuk's room. "Don't worry, Joonghyuk! I'll be here to witness your grand confession when it happens!"</p>
                
                <p>As the door closed behind Nirvana, Yoo Joonghyuk let out a long sigh, his heart still racing. The battle with his shyness was far from over, and the question of what to say to Kim Dokja remained unanswered. But one thing was clear: he would have to confront his own feelings sooner or later, even if it meant stumbling along the way.</p>
                
                <p>Finally, he made up his mind. With a determined look in his eyes, he pressed the call button. The phone rang, each second feeling like an eternity, until it was finally picked up on the other end. Yoo Joonghyuk held his breath, waiting to hear Kim Dokja's voice for the first time.</p>
                
                <p>And then, silence. The other line was quiet for a moment, and Yoo Joonghyuk's heart sank. Had he made a mistake? Was Kim Dokja deliberately avoiding him? He was about to end the call when something unexpected happened.</p>
                
                <p>Just as he was about to end the call, a series of strange beeps interrupted the silence. Yoo Joonghyuk furrowed his brow, his confusion deepening. What was happening? Was this some sort of glitch in the call? He couldn't make sense of the beeps, and his anxiety surged.</p>
                
                <p>A series of beeps echoed through the phone's speaker. Yoo Joonghyuk frowned, not understanding what they meant. It was like Morse code, a repeated pattern of beeps, but he couldn't decipher it. It sounded strange, almost haunting, and he couldn't shake the feeling that there was something more to it.</p>
                
                <p>His mind raced, trying to make sense of the beeps, but he couldn't figure it out. It felt like a puzzle he couldn't solve. Doubt crept in, and he began to wonder if this was a mistake. Maybe he wasn't supposed to make this call, maybe there were forces at play beyond his understanding.</p>
                
                <p>He waited for an explanation, for Kim Dokja's voice to break through the strange noise, but it never came. The beeps continued, growing louder and more insistent. Yoo Joonghyuk's frustration mounted, and he finally couldn't take it anymore. With a heavy heart, he ended the call.</p>
                
                <p>He sat back on his couch, his head in his hands, overwhelmed by a sense of defeat. This had been his only chance to call Kim Dokja privately, to hear his voice without any distractions or interruptions. And he had blown it.</p>
                
                <p>Regret gnawed at him, and he cursed his own cowardice. He had let fear dictate his actions once again, and now he was left with nothing but unanswered questions and a lingering sense of longing. Yoo Joonghyuk knew he couldn't keep running from his feelings, from the connection he felt with Kim Dokja. But whether he would gather the courage to try again remained uncertain.</p>
